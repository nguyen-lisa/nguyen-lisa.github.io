## Executive Summary
- Designed a **chat-style portfolio** that lets recruiters ask preset questions (about, experience, availability) or browse projects traditionally.
- Concept balances **guided prompts** (right rail) with a **standard project/resume nav**, so both scanning and conversational behaviors are supported.
- **Accessibility** was a first-class constraint: high contrast, keyboard operation, visible focus, reduced-motion support.

- **Role:** Freelance UI/UX Designer, Accessibility Tester  
- **Deliverables:** Lo-fi wireframes (Balsamiq), hi-fi flows (Figma), a11y acceptance criteria, developer handoff notes  
- **Accessibility:** Designed to conform to **WCAG 2.0 Level AA (AODA)**; validated keyboard/focus patterns and reduced-motion behavior  
- **Timeline:**  
  - Wireframes (Balsamiq): 2025-09-03

## Context & Objectives
<Subhead>Client context</Subhead>
The client wanted a portfolio that communicates signal quickly to hiring teams—without forcing them to read long case studies first.

<Subhead>Objectives</Subhead>
- **Faster answers:** guided prompts to “Tell me about yourself,” “What tools do you use?”, “What’s your availability?”  
- **Keep projects first-class:** card grid with clear actions (view demo / read case study).  
- **Respect accessibility:** predictable layout, headings/landmarks, visible focus, and non-color cues.

## Wireframing & Prototyping
<Subhead>Wireframe v4 — chat-focused, guided discovery</Subhead>

- **Right-rail prompts** reduce cognitive load and route to key sections quickly.  
- **Dual navigation** (Projects/Resume *and* conversational prompts) keeps the site scannable.  
- **Smart chips** near the composer (Availability, Experience, Projects, Resume) provide one-tap shortcuts.  
- **Accessible defaults:** large targets, clear focus outlines, and a logical tab order.

<Subhead>Hi-fi exploration (Figma)</Subhead>
- High-contrast theme and obvious focus states.  
- Motion used sparingly; honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.  
- Labels and headings tuned for screen readers (e.g., “Menu” instead of “TOC”).

## Accessibility & AODA
- Targeted **WCAG 2.0 AA (AODA)** with checks for keyboard operation, focus visibility, and reduced-motion support (2.1/2.2 relevant criteria).  
- Verified with **Lighthouse** (A11y 100 on internal builds), **axe DevTools (Free)** spot checks (no critical issues on representative screens), and **Colour Contrast Analyser** for text, buttons, and links.  
- **Non-color cues** (underline, thicker borders) reinforce state changes beyond color alone.

## Testing & Handoff
- **Keyboard-only pass** to confirm tab order, focus trapping for overlays, and skip-to-content behavior.  
- **Handoff package**: component specs (states/roles), tokens, contrast values, motion guidelines, and a11y acceptance criteria for QA.  
- Provided notes on how to implement with a typical **Next.js/MDX** stack if the client pursues development later.

## Outcome & Next Steps
- Client aligned on the chat-focused direction with guided prompts and conventional navigation.  
- Next: finalize brand visuals, expand component library, and proceed to development with the supplied **a11y acceptance criteria**.

> **Note:** This case study showcases **design and a11y validation** deliverables; code implementation is out of scope for this engagement.
