## Executive Summary
- Designed a **chat-style portfolio** so recruiters can ask questions (About, Experience, Availability) or skim **compact project cards** (short blurb + optional Demo/Repo).
- Introduced an **AI-ready chat box**: works today with **guided prompts** + **scripted answers**, and can plug into an LLM later without UI changes.
- **Accessibility** was first-class: high contrast, keyboard operation, visible focus, and reduced-motion support (AODA / WCAG 2.0 AA oriented).

## Context & Objectives
<Subhead>Client context</Subhead>
The client needs to communicate credibility **in seconds**—fast access to resume, a concise picture of experience, and easy contact—without deep reading.

<Subhead>Objectives</Subhead>
- **Faster answers:** guided prompts for “About me,” “Tools,” and “Availability.”  
- **Compact projects:** small cards with a **one-line summary** and optional **Demo/Repo** link.  
- **Accessibility by default:** predictable headings/landmarks, visible focus, and non-color cues.

## AI Chat Box
<Subhead>How it works today (no backend)</Subhead>
- **Prompt chips** (About · Experience · Availability · Projects · Resume) populate the input with a suggested question.  
- **Scripted answers** render as chat bubbles with scannable subheads and links (resume, featured projects).  
- **Free-text input** is enabled; unknown queries fall back to a helpful menu (“You can ask about…”) instead of dead-ends.

<Subhead>LLM-ready later</Subhead>
- Same interface; swap the answer source to an API.  
- **Content model** supports summarization: short bios, one-line project blurbs, tags, and canonical links for grounding.  
- **Safety & clarity:** an “About summaries” note explains that generated answers are derived from on-page content.

<Subhead>Accessibility patterns (chat)</Subhead>
- **Keyboard:** Tab to focus input; **Enter** sends; **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline; **Esc** clears suggestion.  
- **Announce replies:** new assistant messages use `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers.  
- **Landmarks:** `<main>` contains both chat and the project list; chat header is labeled (“Ask about [user]”).  
- **Focus:** focus returns to the input after send; visible focus rings throughout.  
- **Reduced motion:** typing indicators and scroll-to-latest respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Wireframing & Prototyping
<Subhead>Wireframe v4 — chat-focused, guided discovery</Subhead>

- **Right-rail prompts** reduce cognitive load and route to key answers quickly.  
- **Dual entry paths:** conversational **prompt chips** and **standard nav** (Projects/Resume) for familiar scanning.  
- **Compact project cards:** title + short blurb + **Demo/Repo** link—keeps the page light and scannable.  
- **Accessible defaults:** large targets, visible focus, logical tab order, reduced-motion awareness.

## Outcome & Next Steps
- Alignment on **chat-first discovery** with **compact project cards** and an **AI-ready chat box** for speed.  
- **Next:** prepare hi-fi prototype, finalize brand visuals, expand the component library, and hand off for development with the established **WCAG 2.0 AA acceptance criteria**.

> **Status:** On hold pending client content. Design deliverables are production-ready; development can resume immediately after asset delivery.
