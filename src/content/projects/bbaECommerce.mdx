# Beauty By Aphrodite

**Live:** [beauty-by-aphrodite-website.vercel.app](https://beauty-by-aphrodite-website.vercel.app/)  
**Repo:** [github.com/nguyen-lisa/BeautyByAphroditeWebsite](https://github.com/nguyen-lisa/BeautyByAphroditeWebsite)

I **modernized** an older, mostly static e-commerce site into a **Next.js (App Router)** application with a mobile-first, accessible UX. The visual aesthetic was **client-directed** (freelance) — playful, simple, and product-first.

> **Project status:** The site is intentionally paused at this stage until the client is ready to proceed with payments and to add their own products.  
> Current products shown are **placeholders**.

---

## Goals

- Replace ad-hoc static pages with a maintainable **App Router** structure.
- Ship an **accessible** two-row header (always-visible brand row + collapsible mobile nav that takes zero space when closed).
- Add a **hero** section with clear CTAs (Shop / DM on Instagram).
- Build **/products** and **/products/[slug]** with a keyboard-friendly **thumbnail gallery**.
- Start with **JSON product data** and keep a clean path to Prisma/Stripe/Shopify later.

---

## Highlights

- **Hero:** Split layout (image + copy) with primary + ghost CTAs.  
- **Products:** Grid and detail pages; thumbnails are real **buttons** with `aria-label` and `aria-current` for the active image.  
- **Styling:** Single `app/globals.css` for predictable, framework-free CSS.  
- **Deployment:** Vercel with automatic builds on push.

---

## Accessibility & Performance

Audited with **Lighthouse** and **axe DevTools**.  
All Lighthouse categories currently score **≥ 83/100**; I’m iterating toward **100% accessibility** (contrast, heading order, landmark labels, alt coverage, and focus management).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** JavaScript (React/JSX)
- **Markup & Styles:** Semantic HTML via React + global CSS (`app/globals.css`)
- **Tooling:** ESLint (flat config), Lighthouse, axe DevTools
- **Data (current):** `data/productData.json` (designed to map cleanly to a future Prisma schema)
- **Hosting:** Vercel

---

## Data & Next Steps

- **Now:** Products come from `data/productData.json` for fast iteration.
- **Next (when client proceeds):** Optional migration to **Prisma** (SQLite/Postgres), payments via **Stripe** or Shopify, and an admin product flow.
