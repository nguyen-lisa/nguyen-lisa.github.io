Original Site: [Yale School of Art](https://www.art.yale.edu/)
- Revisited and redesigned a school project from years ago with more design experience.

### The Problem
The Yale School of Art website has become somewhat legendary in design circles for its experimental approach to design.
- Usability: In attempts to reflect the school's spirit, has created a 
- Typography: Inconsistent sizes, colors, and weights make scanning the page impossible.

## Project Overview
<Subhead>Problem Statement</Subhead>
This redesign was first attempted as a high school project, I didn't have the skills to identify root caused or design systematic solutions. Returning years later, I saw an opportunity to demonstrate growth and tackle a geniunely challenging design.

<Subhead>Goal</Subhead>
- Redesign the Yale School of Art's chaotic website into a clean, accessible layout.
- Improve readability and scannability for all user types.
- Maintain creative, artistic identity without sacrificing usability.

<Subhead>Role</Subhead>

## Design Process
<Subhead>Visual System</Subhead>
- Typography: Clear hierarchy with clean sans-serif for readability.
- Color palette: Reduced to 4-5 intentional colors with purpose. All combinations meet contrast requirements.
- Grid system: Consistent spacing and alignment across all pages

<Subhead>Iterations</Subhead>
- V1: Initial redesign from years ago. Too minimal and boring.
- V2: Better redesign but design was a little too distracting from the contents of the page.
- V3 (Final) - Balanced, maintained visual interest while keeping up visual hierarchy.
