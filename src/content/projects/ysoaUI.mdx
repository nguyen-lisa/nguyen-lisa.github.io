# Yale School of Art Redesign

**Prototype:** [View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/cKWzJAojyq5QD5tr3pRC8l/Yale-School-of-Art-Redesign?node-id=1-2&p=f&t=552dYV9RDglMqhu3-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1)  
**Original Site:** [art.yale.edu](https://www.art.yale.edu/)

I **revisited** a school project from years ago - redesigning the Yale School of Art website - and tackled it again with significantly more design experience. The original site is infamous for its chaotic layout, clashing colors, and poor readability. This redesign prioritizes **hierarchy, accessibility, and user needs** while respecting the school's creative identity.

> **Project context:** Originally a high school assignment that I looked back on and realized how much I'd learned. I wanted to see how I could improve with fresh eyes and real experience.  
> **Timeline:** 1 day - researched Yale's website and other art school sites, noted key elements to include and highlight, then prototyped in Figma.

## The Problem

The Yale School of Art website has become somewhat legendary in design circles for its experimental approach. While this reflects the school's avant-garde spirit, it creates significant usability barriers:

- **Illegible typography:** Inconsistent sizes, colors, and weights make scanning the page impossible
- **Color chaos:** Bright, clashing colors used without purpose or hierarchy  
- **Poor information architecture:** Critical information buried or difficult to locate
- **Accessibility failures:** Insufficient contrast ratios, no clear focus states, unpredictable navigation
- **Mobile unfriendly:** Layout breaks on smaller screens, text becomes unreadable

**Why redesign it?** When I first attempted this as a high school project, I didn't have the skills to identify root causes or design systematic solutions. Returning years later, I saw an opportunity to demonstrate growth and tackle a genuinely challenging redesign.

## Goals

- Redesign the Yale School of Art's chaotic website into a clean, accessible layout
- Improve **readability and scannability** for all user types
- Maintain creative, artistic identity without sacrificing usability

---

## Design Process

**Visual System**  
- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy with clean sans-serif for readability
- **Color palette:** Reduced to 4-5 intentional colors with purpose. All combinations meet contrast requirements
- **Grid system:** Consistent spacing and alignment across all pages

**Iterations**  
- **V1 (2022):** Initial redesign from years ago. Too minimal and boring
- **V2:** Better redesign but design was a little too distracting from the contents of the page
- **V3 (Final):** Balanced, maintained visual interest while keeping up visual hierarchy

## Reflection

When I first tackled this project in high school, I simply made it "prettier" without understanding why it was broken. This time, I approached it systematically - identifying problems, researching solutions, making deliberate decisions, and documenting my reasoning. That shift from taste-driven to strategy-driven design marks the biggest evolution in my work.
