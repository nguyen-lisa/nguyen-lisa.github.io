## Executive Summary
- Built an accessibility-first portfolio to centralize work and speed recruiter review.
- Clear paths to **Resume**, **Featured projects**, and **Case studies** with demos.
- High-contrast theme, visible focus rings, keyboard navigation, alt text throughout.

### Tech highlights
- Next.js App Router with **static export** for GitHub Pages (basePath/assetPrefix tuned).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions builds on push to `main` and publishes the static `out/` artifact to Pages.
- **MDX + Contentlayer**: typed `Project` model; front-matter drives routes and TOC.
- Sticky left TOC (IntersectionObserver + offset-aware smooth scroll).
- Accessible lightbox (Esc / ← / →, focus trap, restores focus on close).
- Tailwind v4 tokens + component classes (high-contrast theme, button variants).
- Quality gates: **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y**, **Lighthouse 100**, **axe DevTools** clean.

## Project Overview
<Subhead>Problem Statement</Subhead>
Recruiters often requested a portfolio to validate my abilities, but I didn’t yet have one. I created this project to centralize my work, showcase UI/UX projects, highlight my resume, and supplement my CV.

<Subhead>Goal</Subhead>
Design and launch a clean, accessible, and responsive portfolio website that communicates my skills and professional presence effectively.

<Subhead>Role</Subhead>
Designer, Programmer, Prototyper

<Subhead>Tools</Subhead>
- **Figma** – lo-fi & hi-fi mocks + interactive prototype  
- **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + MDX** – content-driven, accessibility-focused build  
- **axe DevTools, Colour Contrast Analyser** – verify WCAG contrast and semantics  
- **Git + GitHub** – version control and deploy

<Subhead>Success Metrics</Subhead>
- Increase in interview invitations  
- Recruiters and peers requesting to view my portfolio  
- Growth in portfolio website visits

<Subhead>Constraints</Subhead>
The portfolio needed to be completed quickly to meet application deadlines and be ready for recruiter review.

<Subhead>Timeline (2 Weeks)</Subhead>
- Wireframing: lo-fi exploration (1 day) → hi-fi refinement in Figma (1 day)  
- Prototyping: interactive build and component development (5 days)  
- Testing & iteration: usability testing, accessibility validation, refinements (4 days)  
- Launch: final deployment and review (1 day)

## Research & Planning
<Subhead>Target Audience</Subhead>
IT professionals and peers, with an emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.

<Subhead>Accessibility & AODA</Subhead>

- Designed to conform to **WCAG 2.0 Level AA (AODA)**; also checked key **2.1/2.2** criteria (keyboard, focus visibility, reduced motion).
- Verified with **Lighthouse** (A11y 100, Perf 100), **axe DevTools** (no critical violations), and **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y** (clean CI).
- Color contrast validated with **Colour Contrast Analyser**; all interactive controls have visible focus and non-color cues.

<Subhead>Comparative Analysis</Subhead>
I reviewed 10+ portfolios on Behance and UXfolio, and also studied sites from several of my favourite **indie game developers** (solo and small teams) to stay current on interaction patterns and publishing workflows. Key takeaways:

- **Clarity over volume:** the strongest portfolios lead with 2–4 polished projects vs. long “work dumps.”
- **Case-study depth:** clear problem → approach → outcome structure with scannable subheads works best.
- **Live artifacts matter:** playable demos / code links / prototypes build trust faster than screenshots alone.
- **Performance & motion:** lightweight media and restrained animations with `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
- **Tech signal:** concise “built with” sections (framework + tools) help recruiters and peers qualify quickly.

**What I adopted:** featured-first layout, live demo links, concise tool list, and a structured case-study template.  
**What I avoided:** heavy hero videos, autoplay media, and overly experimental navigation that hurts accessibility.

<Subhead>User Personas</Subhead>
- **Hiring Manager:** Needs quick access to the resume and a clear overview of skills  
- **IT Peer / Collaborator:** Interested in project details and experience for potential collaboration

<Subhead>Storyboarding</Subhead>
I storyboarded two primary journeys to confirm that navigation supported both hiring and collaboration needs.

- *Recruiter journey:* Lands on home → finds resume in under 2 seconds → optionally reviews projects for context.  


- *Peer/collaborator journey:* “See All Projects” → filter → open a case study → try demo.  


## Wireframing & Prototyping
After validating flows, I translated them into wireframes to lock structure and navigation before visual polish.

<Subhead>Components</Subhead>
I standardized the navigation bar, project cards, buttons, and footer. Each meets accessibility expectations: sufficient contrast, large click/tap areas, visible focus, and non-color cues on hover.

<Subhead>Design Decisions</Subhead>
- **Palette:** Switched from pastel to high-contrast after contrast failures; ensures **AA** for default, hover, focus, and disabled states.  
- **Nav clarity:** Resume link moved from footer → navbar after **3/5** testers missed it; now **5/5** find it in < 2s.  
- **Components:** Button variants with visible focus rings, hover underline, and thicker borders to signal interactivity.

## User Testing & Feedback
<Subhead>Participants & Tasks</Subhead>
- **5 testers** (2 hiring-adjacent, 3 peers)  
- Tasks: open resume; find one featured project; navigate to demo; keyboard-only pass

<Subhead>Findings</Subhead>
- Resume link in footer **missed by 3/5** → moved to navbar → **5/5** success  
- Button hover contrast too subtle → added **border-2** + underline on hover  
- Case study TOC sticky state jitter → added offset-aware smooth scroll and stable active-section detection

<Subhead>Changes Shipped</Subhead>
Promoted resume to main nav; improved button hover/focus; stabilized TOC behavior.

<Subhead>Results</Subhead>
- Keyboard-only task completion: **100%**  
- Contrast checks pass (text and interactive states)

<Subhead>Challenges & fixes</Subhead>

- **Contentlayer on Windows (CRLF):** Front-matter booleans and line endings caused parse errors → normalized LF, quoted strings, validated schema.
- **MDX inside `<details>`:** Markdown isn’t parsed in raw HTML → used `<ul><li>` + ensured image arrays were valid (commas/quotes).
- **Sticky TOC overlap/jitter:** Added offset-aware smooth scroll and IntersectionObserver with tuned `rootMargin`; moved sticky to a non-overflow wrapper.
- **Images & performance:** Switched to `next/image` for in-content previews (LCP), kept plain `<img>` inside the lightbox for simplicity; all images have descriptive `alt`.

## Final Design & Launch
<Subhead>Outcome</Subhead>
A polished, responsive, accessibility-first portfolio that effectively represents my skills and professional identity.  
[Insert screenshots of desktop and mobile versions, alongside earlier iterations]

<Subhead>Reflection</Subhead>
Accessibility was the strongest success. **Colour Contrast Analyser** and **axe DevTools** surfaced issues that weren’t always obvious. The main challenge was balancing aesthetics with accessibility—pastel palettes and experimental layouts often conflicted with WCAG, so I prioritized inclusivity and usability. I plan to build a secondary, experimental portfolio to explore unconventional designs while keeping this primary site professional and AA-focused.
