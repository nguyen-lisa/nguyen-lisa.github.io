The original site is infamous for its chaotic layout, clashing colors, and poor readability. This redesign prioritizes **hierarchy, accessibility, and user needs** while respecting the school's creative identity.\r\n\r\n> **Project context:** Originally a high school assignment that I looked back on and realized how much I'd learned. I wanted to see how I could improve with fresh eyes and real experience.  \r\n> **Timeline:** 1 day - researched Yale's website and other art school sites, noted key elements to include and highlight, then prototyped in Figma.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nThe Yale School of Art website has become somewhat legendary in design circles for its experimental approach. While this reflects the school's avant-garde spirit, it creates significant usability barriers:\r\n\r\n- **Illegible typography:** Inconsistent sizes, colors, and weights make scanning the page impossible\r\n- **Color chaos:** Bright, clashing colors used without purpose or hierarchy  \r\n- **Poor information architecture:** Critical information buried or difficult to locate\r\n- **Accessibility failures:** Insufficient contrast ratios, no clear focus states, unpredictable navigation\r\n- **Mobile unfriendly:** Layout breaks on smaller screens, text becomes unreadable\r\n\r\n**Why redesign it?** When I first attempted this as a high school project, I didn't have the skills to identify root causes or design systematic solutions. Returning years later, I saw an opportunity to demonstrate growth and tackle a genuinely challenging redesign.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n- Redesign the Yale School of Art's chaotic website into a clean, accessible layout\r\n- Improve **readability and scannability** for all user types\r\n- Maintain creative, artistic identity without sacrificing usability\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Design Process\r\n\r\n**Visual System**  \r\n- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy with clean sans-serif for readability\r\n- **Color palette:** Reduced to 4-5 intentional colors with purpose. All combinations meet contrast requirements\r\n- **Grid system:** Consistent spacing and alignment across all pages\r\n\r\n**Iterations**  \r\n- **V1 (2022):** Initial redesign from years ago. Too minimal and boring\r\n- **V2:** Better redesign but design was a little too distracting from the contents of the page\r\n- **V3 (Final):** Balanced, maintained visual interest while keeping up visual hierarchy\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Reflection\r\n\r\nWhen I first tackled this project in high school, I simply made it \"prettier\" without understanding why it was broken. This time, I approached it systematically - identifying problems, researching solutions, making deliberate decisions, and documenting my reasoning. That shift from taste-driven to strategy-driven design marks the biggest evolution in my work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n<ImageGrid\r\n  images={[\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/soaLanding.png\", alt: \"Original Yale School of Art landing page\", caption: \"Original Yale School of Art landing page as of December 22, 2025.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/firstRedesign.png\", alt: \"Initial redesign of Yale School of Art landing page\", caption: \"My initial redesign of Yale School of Art landing page as of 2022.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/myLanding.png\", alt: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art landing page\", caption: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art landing page.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/soaCalendar.png\", alt: \"Original Yale School of Art event calendar section\", caption: \"Original Yale School of Art event calendar section as of December 22, 2025.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/myCalendar.png\", alt: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art event calendar section\", caption: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art event calendar section.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/soaCommunity.png\", alt: \"Original Yale School of Art Community Bulletin Board section\", caption: \"Original Yale School of Art Community Bulletin Board section as of December 22, 2025.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/myCommunity.png\", alt: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art Community Bulletin Board section\", caption: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art Community Bulletin Board.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/soaNews.png\", alt: \"Original Yale School of Art Newsletter section\", caption: \"Original Yale School of Art Newsletter section as of December 22, 2025.\" },\r\n    { src: \"/images/ysoa/myNews.png\", alt: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art Newsletter section\", caption: \"My redesign of Yale School of Art Newsletter.\" }\r\n  ]}\r\n/>",
